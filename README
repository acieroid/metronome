`metronome' allows you to have a metronome without having a soundcard or
speakers, it can use the motherboard beep, the leds or simply output text
to the terminal to signal beats.

To install it, just run:
  $ make
  # make install

You'll probably need to launch metronome in root to control the leds and the
motherboard tone (contributions are welcome if anyone knows how to avoid that).

See metronome(1) (man metronome) for more informations
